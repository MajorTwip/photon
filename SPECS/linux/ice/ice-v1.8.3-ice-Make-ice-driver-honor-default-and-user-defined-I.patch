Subject: [PATCH] ice: Make ice driver honor default and user-defined IRQ
 affinities

The ice driver completely ignores the default system-wide IRQ
affinity (set via the irqaffinity= kernel cmdline parameter) and
spreads its interrupts across all online CPUs instead.

Furthermore, if a user/administrator (or a service such as tuned or
irqbalance) overrides the default IRQ affinity for the ice driver's
interrupts using the per-IRQ procfs interface (eg: by writing the
desired cpulist to /proc/irq/<IRQ>/smp_affinity_list), the driver is
supposed to remember this setting (as indicated by the
IRQD_AFFINITY_SET flag) and restore it if the underlying device gets
bounced or reinitialized (eg: ifconfig <NIC> down; ifconfig <NIC> up).
Instead, the ice driver once again spreads its interrupts across all
online CPUs, and thus fails to honor the user-defined IRQ affinities
as well.

The underlying root-cause for both of these issues is the incorrect
use of the irq_set_affinity_hint() API in the driver's interrupt
request code-path at the time of probe. The driver calls this API with
the affinity mask set to all online CPUs, which ends up getting
remembered as the user-defined IRQ affinity (overriding both the
default system-wide IRQ affinity as well as the user's actual IRQ
affinity setting).

Fix this by removing the call to irq_set_affinity_hint() in the
driver's initialization code.
